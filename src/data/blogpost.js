    title: "Embracing the Next Industrial Revolution: Why the AI Foundry?",

    content: `# Embracing the Next Industrial Revolution: Why the AI Foundry (An Open Letter to College Students)

As I prepare for life after college, I think about the rapidly evolving world. The current technological revolution, referred to as "Industry 4.0", is a paradigm shift in how professionals operate. One of the most striking parallels is the First Industrial Revolution. If you've studied history, you know that our labor force in the United States shifted from 90% working on farms to 40% working on farms in less than 100 years. Now, less than 1.5% of our population is employed in direct on-farm labor.

If we abstractly extrapolate that type of productivity growth to the present, the future is exciting, scary, cataclysmic, transformative, and mind-blowing---all at once. What jobs will disappear? How can students prepare for this rapidly shifting landscape?

Gary Coleman, Global Industry and Senior Client Advisor at Deloitte Consulting, says, "The Fourth Industrial Revolution is still in its nascent state. But with the swift pace of change and disruption to business and society, the time to join in is now." Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, believes that artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a new industrial revolution. He argues that this revolution is comparable to the transformative impact of electricity and will lead to significant productivity growth across various industries. Richard Susskind, a prominent philosopher and author on the future of professions, says, "Technology will be the main driver of this change. And, in the long run, we will neither need nor want professionals to work in the way that they did in the twentieth century and before".

One thing we can be sure of is that we can't be sure of anything. In the words of Socrates, "I only know that I know nothing." Uncertainty is here to stay; its presence reminds us to remain open-minded, curious, and flexible.

Resisting this change would be analogous to an oak tree in a windstorm. The tree has developed a strong trunk and deep roots, which serve it well in calm weather. Suddenly, a powerful storm comes, bringing strong winds that threaten to uproot the tree. If the tree remains rigid, it will snap or be uprooted; however, if it is flexible, learning to bend and sway in chaos, it will survive and grow even stronger.

So, at the AI Foundry, our mission is to create an organization to better prepare you for the workforce. With AI agents, a team of one can do the job of many. The AI Foundry is designed to give you real-world experience and help you pick up new skills quickly. We want to help you transition from thinking in rigid, linear ways to exploring bold ideas that leverage the ever-expanding toolkit of AI and related technologies.

The wall starts to crumble until it falls all at once. At the AI Foundry, we want students to be prepared for when the wall falls.
